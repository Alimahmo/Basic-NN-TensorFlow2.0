# Basic-NN-TensorFlow2.0
Simple Machine Learning Algorithm in TensorFlow2.0 using Linear Regression model, using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm and Mean Squared Error as our Loss Function

**SUMMARY
**
**Model**: Linear Regression
**Algorithm**: Stochastic Gradient Descent
**Objective** **Function**: Loss Function = Mean Squared Error

TF2.0 works with Tensors, so, it does not work well with Excel and CSV files.
We want a format that can store the information in Tensors: .npz files --> it is NumPyâ€™s file type. Stores n-dimensional arrays.
Tensors can be represented as n-d arrays
